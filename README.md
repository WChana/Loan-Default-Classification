# Loan-Default-Classification
• Created an auto loan default classification model with XGBoost, achieving an accuracy of 92% and auROC of 0.98
• Conducted data analysis, performed extensive data cleaning, and reduced the feature space from 40 to 32
• Tested various models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. Selected Random 
  Forest based on metrics such as precision, recall, ROC curves, and gain curves
• Optimized model performance by tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV and presented the findings in a
comprehensive report
